Although the steps to follow are very well detailed in this video or in these notes, there are some issues still worth noting for Mac users.\n\n## 1. Connection of EC2 to local machine\n\nAs suggested by the instructor, the most convenient type of instance is a t2,xlarge Amazon Linux. Once launched on AWS management console the way to connect to your local machine is by locating the `.pem` created while starting the instance in the .ssh (hidden) folder and running the following command in the terminal\n\n`ssh -i ~/.ssh/pepino.pem ec2-user@<public IPv4 address>`\n\n![](ssh_folder.png){width=\"692\"}\n\nNote that the user name associated with Mac is not `@ubuntu` but `ec2-user` instead. Apart from that, the remaining steps detailed in the video to provide an alias to Host remain the same. The aim for that is to avoid typing such a long instruction and connect it using the alias instead.\n\n![](connection.png)\n\n## 2. Installation of Docker\n\nThe installation of Docker on EC2 is not on Linux so the instructions using the `apt` command will not work. As an alternative there are options that recommend the following commands on the terminal \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlso, the Amazon Linux instance is likely to be from 2023.\n",
