If you want to create a MLOps project, it is likely that you will interact with services offered by a cloud provider. For doing that you will likely require to link your local machine to any of the instances offered by the cloud provider. In this blog, we will see how to set up the environment for a Mac machine to work with an EC2 instance on AWS. 

### Launch an instance in AWS 

In general terms, an instance is a server that provides computing services and that is managed by the cloud provider. AWS offers different types of instances depending on the activity to be performed (computation, memory intensive or graphic intensive).

The most common instances for general use are the Elastic Compute Cloud - *EC2*  - which offer a [range of combinations](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?trk=e011bdeb-247d-4bc7-92eb-1b11f87bfc8a&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw-IWkBhBTEiwA2exyO1pn8lCc9XWbS9Jujs1qGVQdBcNcmaCJ2CPeIfz5OMPBTyODbXKkjhoCOTkQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536392708261!e!!g!!aws%20ec2%20instance%20types!12195830327!119606867160) in terms of CPU, storage and networking capacity. For choosing the right instance there are three main points to consider:

-   [Define the operating system for the Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html): Linux, macOS, Ubuntu, Windows...

-   [Define the instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) : nano, mini, large...

-   [Define the key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) : This is important for connecting your local machine to the instance since these are the security credentials to prove the identity when connecting to an EC2 instance. There are two key types available: `.pem` and `.ppk`

### Connection of EC2 to local machine

A convenient type of instance for MLOps at user lever can be a `t2.xlarge` Amazon Linux 2023. Yet, the choice of the type of instance will depend on the nature of the project and the budget available.

#### Locate the key pair file in your machine

Once the instance is launched on AWS management console, the way to connect it to your local machine is by locating the `.pem` key pair created when launching the instance, in the .ssh (hidden)[^1] folder of the local machine and running the following command on the terminal

[^1]: To view hidden folders on mac press Command + Shift + Dot

`ssh -i ~/.ssh/<name of pem_file.pem> ec2-user@<public IPv4 address>`

The code essentially allows and identification of the local machine in the AWS instance. Note that the user name associated with Mac is not `@ubuntu` but `ec2-user` instead.

#### Modify the host alias

To avoid adding the public IPv4 address every time the instance is launched, we can modify the config file in the `.ssh` folder and provide an alias (for example `mlops-zoomcamp`) to the Host. The aim for that is to avoid typing such a long instruction and connect it using the alias instead.

The `config` file is composed of the following Linux parameters.

-   **Host:** Is the alias you want to use to launch your instance

-   **HostName:** Is the Public IPv4 address of your instance.

    > ⚠️ Every time the instance is launched this parameter changes and therefore it also needs to be changed in the config file ⚠️
    >

-   **IdentityFile:** File with the pair key

-   **StrictHostKeyChecking:** It specifies if there are host keys checked

#### Link the key pair to AWS instance

To connect to the instance you just need to type the following command

`ssh <host_alias>`

The first time you try to connect you may receive the following message

In that case you need to install the `.pem` key pair downloaded using `chmod 0400 <location_pem_file>` [^2]

[^2]: `chmod` Is a Linux command that sets the permissions for file's access. `0400` enables the user to read but can't write nor execute.

Voilà 🥳 .... now your machine is connected.
